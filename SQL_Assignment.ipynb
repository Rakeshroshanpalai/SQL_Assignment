    "Purpose of Constraints: Constraints ensure data integrity and reliability by restricting the type of data that can be stored in a table. They enforce rules at the column or table level to prevent invalid data entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "NOT NULL: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.\n",
    "PRIMARY KEY: Uniquely identifies each row in a table and cannot have NULL values.\n",
    "UNIQUE: Ensures all values in a column are distinct.\n",
    "CHECK: Enforces specific conditions for a column.\n",
    "FOREIGN KEY: Establishes a link between two tables to maintain referential integrity.\n",
    "DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column if no value is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3) Purpose of the NOT NULL Constraint and Primary Keys\n",
    "NOT NULL Constraint: Prevents a column from containing NULL values. This is applied to ensure mandatory data entry for specific fields like IDs or names.\n",

    "Primary Keys: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It cannot contain NULL values because NULL does not uniquely identify a record.\n",
